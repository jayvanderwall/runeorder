# runeorder
Code to generate graphs showing the order of the Elder Futhark vs. other alphabets

The code creates graphs that display the order of one alphabet on each axis, with each point labeled with the appropriate letter or rune.
The line of best fit is overlayed in orange. The correlation coefficient is provided as rho, and the p-value is also provided as produced by scipy. 
The Spearman correlation coefficient was chosen over the Pearson correlation coefficient as this is not a continuous distribution.
